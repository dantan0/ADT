# algorithm_data-structures

Those are my ongoing lab projects from my algorithm and data structure course at UWaterloo. All codes are programmed in C++. 

lab 0 involves creating a simple music playlist program.

lab 1 involves creating a polynomial program that can read an input file of polynomial coefficients. The program can compare two strings of coefficients as well as perform polynomial calculations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and derivatives. 

lab 2 involves creating DLL (doubly linked list) functions for the DronesManager class and test functions.
