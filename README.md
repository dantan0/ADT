# Algorithms & Data Structures
All programs are written by me and my lab partner: Umar.

- lab 0 involves creating a simple music playlist program.
- lab 1 involves creating a polynomial program that can read an input file of polynomial coefficients and perform calculations.
- lab 2 involves creating DLL (doubly linked list) functions for the DronesManager class and test functions.
- lab 3 involves priority queue operations using heap and binary tree operations. 
- PE involves creating binary tree functions.
