# Algorithms & Data Structures
All codes are programmed in C++ in an object-oriented style along with test cases. The following provides a short description of each lab. 

- lab 0 involves creating a simple music playlist program.
- lab 1 involves creating a polynomial program that can read an input file of polynomial coefficients and perform calculations.
- lab 2 involves creating DLL (doubly linked list) functions for the DronesManager class and test functions.
- lab 3 involves priority queue operations using heap and binary tree operations. 
- PE involves creating binary tree functions.
